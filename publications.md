In this paper, we presented SAOTA, a novel semi-asynchronous FL framework that combines OTA computation and Lyapunov-based online optimization to tackle the challenges of energy efficiency, training latency, and convergence performance in wireless networks. By adaptively selecting clients and allocating transmit power in each round, SAOTA minimizes convergence error while satisfying long-term energy and time constraints. Evaluation shows that SAOTA leads to higher accuracy, faster convergence and lower energy consumption than FL baselines. These results validate the potential of combining semi-asynchronous methods with OTA computation for scalable, resource-efficient FL in realistic deployment scenarios.

In this paper, we studied the effects of scheduling probability and power control in FL. We formulated a stochastic optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes overall communication delay and maximizes the scheduling probability
of each device under long-term constraints of fairness, power consumption, and battery energy storage. Using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework, we developed an algorithm, Sto-POLISH, which analytically solves the formulated problem to determine the optimal scheduling probability and transmission power for each device. The proposed algorithm also integrates energy harvesting, outperforming a benchmark in experimental validation by achieving lower battery energy consumption.

In this paper, we presented an optimization approach in Federated Learning, addressing the trade-off between communication delay, energy consumption, and scheduling devices. We introduced a power control and a novel device scheduling, POLISH, to minimize delay and energy consumption while maximizing the total number of selected devices. The approach also integrates energy harvesting, outperforming a benchmark through experimental validation.
